## Audit Requirements for NDIS Providers
As an NDIS provider, you must undergo audits to maintain registration and demonstrate compliance with the NDIS Practice Standards and Quality Indicators (latest version as of October 2024, based on NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission guidelines). Audits are conducted by approved third-party auditors and include Verification Audits (for lower-risk services) and Certification Audits (for higher-risk or complex services). These ensure safe, high-quality supports for participants.

Audits assess implementation of the **Core Module** (mandatory for all providers) and any applicable **Supplementary Modules** based on your registration groups. Key focus areas include governance, risk management, incident and complaints handling, and participant rights.

### NDIS Code of Conduct Compliance
Providers must adhere to the NDIS Code of Conduct, including:
1. Respect for individual rights, self-determination, and decision-making.
2. Safe and competent service delivery.
3. Integrity, honesty, and transparency.
4. Privacy and confidentiality safeguards.
5. Prevention of violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, and discrimination.
6. Prompt reporting of breaches to authorities.
7. No unjustified higher pricing for NDIS participants.

Non-compliance may lead to certification withdrawal or notification to the NDIS Commission.

### Types of Audits
- **Verification Audit**: For lower-risk registration groups (e.g., Plan Management - Group 0127). Focuses on document review.
- **Certification Audit**: For higher-risk services. Includes Stage 1 (document review) and Stage 2 (onsite implementation assessment, participant interviews, and record reviews). Must start Stage 2 within 3 months of Stage 1.
- **Mid-Term Audit**: Reviews governance, operations, risks, incidents, and corrective actions midway through registration.

Participant involvement uses an opt-out approach: Notify participants of potential inclusion, document opt-outs, and obtain consent for interviews or record reviews.

### Document Upload and Preparation
Upload documents via secure links (e.g., Enabl Health Documents) in organized folders with clear naming (e.g., "Incident Register_Q3_2025.pdf"). Accepted formats: Word (.docx), PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG.
