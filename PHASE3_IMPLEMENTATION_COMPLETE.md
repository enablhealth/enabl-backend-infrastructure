## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Vector Processing Pipeline
```
Document Upload → Text Extraction → Content Chunking → Vector Embeddings → OpenSearch
                                                    ↓
                                  User-Specific Knowledge Base → Bedrock Agent
```

### API Flow
```
Frontend → Semantic Search API → Vector Embeddings → OpenSearch Query → Results
        ↓
        Document Upload → Vector Processing → Knowledge Base Update → Bedrock Sync
```

### Data Storage
- **OpenSearch:** Vector embeddings, document chunks, semantic search index
- **S3:** Original documents, knowledge base content, processed text
- **DynamoDB:** User knowledge base metadata, document references
- **Bedrock:** User-specific knowledge bases, AI model access

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Semantic Search

- **Context-aware results** with relevance scoring
- **Medical category filtering** (lab results, medications, etc.)
- **Real-time search** with streaming results

### ✅ Vector Document Processing
- **Automatic text extraction** from uploaded documents
- **Intelligent chunking** with overlap for context preservation
- **Medical entity recognition** and categorization
- **Embedding generation** using Amazon Titan models

### ✅ User-Specific Knowledge Bases
- **Automatic KB creation** for each user
- **Document sync** on upload
- **Personalized AI responses** based on user's health data
- **Privacy isolation** between users

### ✅ Health Insights (Foundation)
- **Document analytics** and categorization
- **Health timeline** tracking
- **Pattern detection** framework
- **Extensible for advanced analytics**

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. **Start the Frontend**
```bash
cd enabl-webapp
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Summary

**Phase 3 transforms Enabl from a document storage system into a sophisticated health intelligence platform.** Users can now:

1. **Upload documents** and have them automatically processed for semantic search
2. **Search using natural language** to find relevant health information instantly  
3. **Get personalized AI responses** from their own health data via Bedrock Knowledge Bases
4. **View health insights** and document analytics in an intuitive dashboard

The implementation uses **mock APIs for immediate testing** while the complete infrastructure is ready for deployment. This approach allows for rapid iteration and user feedback while building toward a production-ready health AI platform.

**Ready for the next phase: Deploy to AWS and replace mocks with real vector processing! 🚀**
