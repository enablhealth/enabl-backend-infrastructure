## After Creating Each Agent:

1. **Copy the Agent ID** from each created agent
2. **Update your environment variables:**

```bash
BEDROCK_HEALTH_AGENT_ID=ABCD1234EFGH
BEDROCK_APPOINTMENT_AGENT_ID=IJKL5678MNOP
BEDROCK_COMMUNITY_AGENT_ID=QRST9012UVWX
BEDROCK_DOCUMENT_AGENT_ID=YZAB3456CDEF
```

3. **Test each agent** individually before full deployment

## No Docker/ECR Required!

This approach is:
✅ Simpler to set up
✅ More cost-effective
✅ Easier to maintain
✅ Faster deployment
✅ Better for serverless architecture
